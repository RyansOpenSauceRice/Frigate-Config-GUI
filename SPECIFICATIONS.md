# Frigate Config GUI

## Project Overview
A desktop GUI application designed to simplify the configuration of Frigate NVR (Network Video Recorder). This is NOT just another YAML editor - it's a purpose-built tool that makes Frigate configuration accessible and intuitive for users of all technical levels.

### Key Design Principles
1. **Example-Driven Configuration**
   - Every field includes practical examples
   - Tooltips explain the purpose and impact of each setting
   - Common configurations are readily available as templates

2. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Settings are organized by function, not by YAML structure
   - Clear, descriptive labels that explain what each setting does
   - Real-time validation with helpful error messages
   - Visual feedback for configuration impacts
   - Required fields marked with a red asterisk (*), optional fields unmarked

3. **Smart Defaults**
   - Pre-configured with recommended settings
   - Templates for common camera models
   - Intelligent suggestions based on hardware capabilities

### Integration with Existing Frigate Features
- Zone editing will be handled through Frigate's existing visual tools
- This application will focus on configuration aspects not already well-served by the main Frigate UI

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Development Approach:** Test Driven Development (TDD)
- **Distribution:** Flatpak
- **Core Dependencies:**
  - YAML processing libraries for reading/writing configuration files
  - GUI framework (to be determined)
  - Testing framework for TDD implementation

## Key Features
1. **Configuration File Management**
   - Create new Frigate configuration files
   - Load existing configuration files
   - Save and export configuration files
   - Validate configuration structure

2. **GUI Interface**
   - Intuitive form-based configuration
   - Real-time validation
   - Visual feedback for configuration errors
   - Preview capabilities for configuration changes

3. **YAML Processing**
   - Parse existing Frigate YAML configurations
   - Generate valid YAML configurations
   - Maintain formatting and comments (if possible)
   - Validate against Frigate's configuration schema

## Development Methodology
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
  - Write tests first
  - Implement features to pass tests
  - Refactor while maintaining test coverage
  - Continuous integration testing

## Distribution
- Package as Flatpak for Linux systems
- Include all dependencies
- Ensure cross-distribution compatibility
- Provide easy installation process

## Future Considerations
- Support for different Frigate versions
- Configuration templates
- Backup and restore functionality
- Configuration comparison tools
- Multi-language support

## Reference Documentation

### Official Frigate Documentation
- Main Documentation: https://docs.frigate.video/
- Configuration Reference: https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/reference
- Configuration File Examples: https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/examples

### Development References
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate
- Documentation Source: https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/tree/dev/docs/docs

## Important Notes

### Documentation Usage
- This project references and works with Frigate NVR configurations as specified in the official Frigate documentation
- The official Frigate documentation should NOT be copied or uploaded to this repository
- Users and contributors should always refer to the official Frigate documentation at https://docs.frigate.video/
- This project aims to provide GUI tools for managing Frigate configurations while respecting the original project's documentation and licensing

### Rate Limiting Considerations
- When interacting with GitHub repositories for config management:
  - Implement proper rate limit handling
  - Cache responses where appropriate
  - Minimize API calls by batching operations
  - Provide clear feedback to users when rate limits are approaching

Note: This specification will be updated as the project evolves and specific requirements for Frigate configuration files are discussed.
