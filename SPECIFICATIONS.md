# Frigate Config GUI

## Project Overview
A desktop GUI application designed to simplify the configuration of Frigate NVR (Network Video Recorder) config files. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and managing Frigate configuration files, eliminating the need for manual YAML editing.

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Development Approach:** Test Driven Development (TDD)
- **Distribution:** Flatpak
- **Core Dependencies:**
  - YAML processing libraries for reading/writing configuration files
  - GUI framework (to be determined)
  - Testing framework for TDD implementation

## Key Features
1. **Configuration File Management**
   - Create new Frigate configuration files
   - Load existing configuration files
   - Save and export configuration files
   - Validate configuration structure

2. **GUI Interface**
   - Intuitive form-based configuration
   - Real-time validation
   - Visual feedback for configuration errors
   - Preview capabilities for configuration changes

3. **YAML Processing**
   - Parse existing Frigate YAML configurations
   - Generate valid YAML configurations
   - Maintain formatting and comments (if possible)
   - Validate against Frigate's configuration schema

## Development Methodology
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
  - Write tests first
  - Implement features to pass tests
  - Refactor while maintaining test coverage
  - Continuous integration testing

## Distribution
- Package as Flatpak for Linux systems
- Include all dependencies
- Ensure cross-distribution compatibility
- Provide easy installation process

## Future Considerations
- Support for different Frigate versions
- Configuration templates
- Backup and restore functionality
- Configuration comparison tools
- Multi-language support
