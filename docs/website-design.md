# Website Plan

## Purpose
The GitHub Pages site serves as a professional showcase for the Frigate Config GUI tool. It is designed to:
- Highlight the tool's purpose and features.
- Provide a clean, modern interface for visitors.
- Serve as a "checkbox" for collaborators.

## Design
- Colors: Blue (#1e90ff), Black (#333), and Yellow (#ffd700).
- Font: Lexend Deca (via Google Fonts).
- Layout: Minimalist, with clear sections for About, Roadmap, and Screenshots.

## Content
- About: Brief description of the tool and its purpose.
- Roadmap: Link to the GitHub repository for updates.
- Screenshots: Placeholder section for future screenshots.

## Multilingual Support
- Automatically detect user language (English, Spanish, French, Simplified Mandarin).
- Use AI-generated translations for non-English content.

## Deployment
- Use GitHub Pages with a free github.io domain.
- Serve the site from the docs/website/ folder.

## Notes
- Screenshots will be added later.
